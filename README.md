# Medical Expenses Prediction Model using regression

This project is part of the **Machine Learning with Python Certification** offered by **freeCodeCamp**. The objective is to build a regression model that predicts healthcare costs based on patient data.

## Project Overview
In this project, we:
- Load and preprocess a dataset containing patient information and healthcare expenses.
- Convert categorical variables into numerical values.
- Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- Implement a regression model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Train the model and evaluate it using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Ensure the model achieves an MAE below 3500 to pass the challenge.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various attributes of individuals along with their healthcare costs. After preprocessing, it consists of:
- Features used to predict expenses.
- Labels (healthcare costs) for training and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
